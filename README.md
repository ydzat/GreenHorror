# GreenHorror
A VR game that pays homage to the P.T.

# Guide

## Requirements:
 + VR device: Quest 2/3, Vive Pro 1/2/Pro Eye, devices of the same model with different versions should also work (not tested).
 + Windows 10/11

## Play
 + Download it from the [Release page](https://github.com/ydzat/GreenHorror/releases/tag/VRGame), unzip it, and execute the .exe file.
 + Recommended to play with sound on
 + Key items dropped off the map will be reset to the last ‘unattached’ location:
    + Example 1: You pick up a flash light at A, you walk to B with it, but when you put it down it falls off the map, then it will reset the position to A.
    + Example 2: You have pushed the key item out of the map by model collision at A. Then the item will reappear at A.
 + The game does not have an exit key, to close the game please use Alt+F4.
 + Unexpected bugs may occur in the game, such as key items not being picked up, not being able to be ejected, incorrect judgement, etc. Solution: restart.
 + Press the buttons on the workbench: use the buttons on the underside of the left handle. For example, for a Quest device, it's `X`, but for a Vive device, it's `A`.

## Issues
 + The sound of footsteps may disappear.
 + Some key items may be reset to the wrong location.
 + There's a blue upgrade module that may not be reachable, so if you're stuck with that issue, please contact me!
 + A particular monster may behave very strangely.
 + Feel free to leave a comment in the Issues module if you run into any other problems! However, this project may not be developed further.
